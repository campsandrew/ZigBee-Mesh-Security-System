# ZigBee-Mesh-Security-System

Name: Andrew Camps, Jason Tran, Derek Paris, Kathleen
Class: ECE 372 Microprocessors

Description: This was a platform.io team project that involved a mesh
of three arduino megas. The arduinos would communicate wirelessly 
using a ZigBee protocol. To relay information to each Zigbee module
UART was used. The information that was relayed from module to module
was if a ultrasonic sensor was trigger. This was trigger a buzzer
on all modules at once and an LCD display screen would tell the user
what module was triggered.
